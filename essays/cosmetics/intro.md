### Definition

Cosmetics are by no means a new idea. Even though it has attracted the attention of a lot of people recently, our history was matted with it since immemorial times<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.

The word "cosmetic" can be used in a couple of different ways:

- As an adjective, "cosmetic" refers to something that improves the look and feel of the skin. _This could be a cream, a treatment, or anything else that enhances our appearance._

- As a noun, it’s the actual product we use—whether it's skincare creams, makeup, hair products, perfumes, or even nail polish.
